#               An example hook script
#           - To give you some quick idea -
#           ###############################

## Okay so here we go...
## Basically if you wanna start with this example script,
## then copy this `example_hook` dir into `hooks/` dir.
## Then start up editing it's `bd.hook.sh`.

# At first I wanna wipe up 'system/lib/hw'
wipedir "$SYSTEM_DIR/lib/hw" || exit
# Alternative: `wipedir "$MOUNT_DIR_SYSTEM/lib/hw"`

# Now I want to merge my own hw files there from my HOOK_BASE (hooks/example_hook).
gclone "$HOOK_BASE/myhw/" "$SYSTEM_DIR/lib/hw" || exit
# TIP: Now you might be thingking why don't we just do `rm -r "$SYSTEM_DIR/lib/hw"`
#      and then do `gclone "$HOOK_BASE/myhw" "$SYSTEM_DIR/lib/hw"` ?
#      
#      Well, as you see, with `wipedir` we are preserving the dir with
#      it's permissions and other file attriutes, while that's not the
#      case if you directly use `rm`. For that case you need to re-set
#      the correct file attrs for the dir, thus requiring you to know
#      the correct attrs to apply.

# Okay now lets print a message on the terminal to let the user know that our hook was applied properly just for extra awesomeness, lol.
